This comprehensive file is designed to be placed in the root directory (e.g., `AGENDA.md` or `README.md`) of each of the three designated repositories. It outlines the modular architecture, explains the role of each agenda, and grounds the work within the project's strategic mission.

# Project Architecture: 3-Repo / 3-Agenda System

## 1. Grand Scheme Alignment: The Purpose of this Architecture

This entire architecture—comprising three highly specialized agendas—is rooted in **systems resilience engineering** [1] and designed to be a disruptive force [2]. The core mission is to **empower historically marginalized communities on a global scale** [2] and seize a **"huge commercial opportunity serving an underestimated market"** [3].

The separation of concerns across these three agendas ensures **flawless security, clarity, and modularity** [4] while creating an ecosystem that is **antifragile** (i.e., stronger from stress) [1, 5].

The system achieves this by implementing the **"Institutional Arbitrage Empowerment Framework,"** which leverages gaps in traditional systems [6] by positioning the platform as a **"financial inclusion technology solution provider"** [6].

## 2. The 3-Repo / 3-Agenda System

The platform is divided into three distinct agendas, each corresponding to a specific focus area and enforcing maximum security through isolation:

| Agenda | Repository | Primary Focus | Role in Ecosystem |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agenda 1** | **`cheetahcoin-contracts`** | Core Token & Governance | Defines the $CHT$ token, staking, treasury, and decentralized voting rights [7]. |
| **Agenda 2** | **`overlay365-chain`** | Bespoke Infrastructure | The proprietary **Overlay365** governance chain and consensus mechanism [8, 9]. |
| **Agenda 3** | **Synchronization Layer** | External Interoperability | Manages the strategic pivot to external L2s (like Base) for discovery and content monetization [10, 11]. |

## 3. Inter-Agenda Relationships: The Connectivity Nexus

The three agendas are mutually dependent, forming a secure, resilient operating system:

1.  **Agenda 1 $\leftrightarrow$ Agenda 2 (Token and Chain Core):**
    *   The **$CHT$ Token** (Agenda 1) is deployed as an AggLayer-compatible ERC-20 token [7, 12].
    *   Its core financial mechanisms (treasury and staking) reside in the `cheetahcoin-contracts` repo (Agenda 1) [7].
    *   The complex governance logic, including **timelocks (min. 2 days)** and **multi-sig execution** [13], is managed by modules on the **Overlay365 chain** (Agenda 2) [8, 14]. The bespoke chain (Agenda 2) serves as the secure execution environment for the token’s governance.

2.  **Agenda 3 $\leftrightarrow$ All Other Agendas (Growth and Resilience):**
    *   Agenda 3 leverages Base as the **"dynamic Layer 2 social and creator economy channel"** for content, tradeable posts, and discovery [10, 15].
    *   It uses **Cross-Chain Identity & Token Bridges** [11] to link Base wallets/activities back to Overlay365 (Agenda 2), ensuring seamless user movement and token flow [16].
    *   Synchronization logic (Agenda 3) ensures that while content is tradable on Base, **advanced DAO treasury management, royalty splits, and proprietary IP** remain secured and controlled on the **Overlay365** chain (Agenda 2) [14].
    *   Agenda 3 also integrates systemic defense infrastructure, such as the **Orbital Backbone** (Starlink) for unbreakable access [17] and **"Grok Nodes"** (Truth-Seeking AI Oracles) for predictive defense, which are critical for the ecosystem's long-term antifragility [18].

## 4. [Copilot: INSERT THIS REPOSITORY'S FOCUS]

***
### **If placed in `cheetahcoin-contracts` (Agenda 1):**

**This Repository's Focus: Core Financial and Governance Contracts**

This repository is dedicated to building the foundational smart contracts of the ecosystem. Your work here defines the **CheetahCoin ($CHT)** token and the mechanisms that control its supply, distribution, and decentralized governance.

**Key Components within this Repo:**

*   ERC-20 token contract (AggLayer compatible) [7].
*   Governance voting module (**ERC-20Votes**) [7].
*   Staking contract, defining transparent penalties and APYs [13].
*   Treasury multi-sig smart contract [7].
*   **Crucial Guardrail:** Use **`ReentrancyGuard`** and enforce **95%+ test coverage** for all financial logic [13, 19]. Governance must adhere to **fail-safes** and **timelocks** [13].

***
### **If placed in `overlay365-chain` (Agenda 2):**

**This Repository's Focus: Bespoke Blockchain Infrastructure (Overlay365)**

This repository is the secure, proprietary governance chain where the most complex and mission-critical logic resides. This infrastructure is required to achieve **systemic resilience** and maintain centralized control over core financial and social logic [14].

**Key Components within this Repo:**

*   Bespoke chain configuration (consensus and security guardrails) [8].
*   **Cross-chain bridge modules** (for L1/L2, Polygon+Base) [8].
*   Module for **advanced DAOs, governance, and treasury** [8].
*   On-chain Cheetah auditing/orchestration agent [8].
*   **Crucial Guardrail:** Node code must use **established frameworks** and **never introduce unaudited changes from AI suggestions** [20]. The design must facilitate **Decentralized Backup** across multiple jurisdictions for sovereignty [21].

***
### **If placed in Synchronization Layer Repo (Agenda 3):**

**This Repository's Focus: External Interoperability and Synchronization**

This repository governs the strategic pivot to external platforms (like Base) and manages the flow of users, tokens, and data between the proprietary chain (Agenda 2) and the external Layer 2 environments [22]. This is the engine for market growth and the **Creator Economy Layer** [23].

**Key Components within this Repo:**

*   Cross-Chain Identity & Token Bridge logic [11].
*   NFT Licensing Synchronization, making Overlay365 NFTs tradable on Base's social graph [11].
*   Integration of predictive defense tools (**"Grok Nodes"**) [18] and the **Orbital Backbone** (Starlink integration) [17].
*   **Crucial Guardrail:** **Proprietary IP** and control over advanced governance must remain confined to Agenda 2, and all external interfaces must adhere to **privacy-first features** (Community Shield Protocol) [24].
